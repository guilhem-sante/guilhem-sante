### Welcome to my Profile Page

Thank you for taking an interest in me.  

#### About Me

I'm currently pursuing my postgraduate degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Cloud Computing and Machine Learning.  

I'm drawn to Cloud Computing because it provides me with a deeper understanding of software development's implications, instills confidence in initiating my own projects, and offers an excellent platform for open-source development.  

As for Machine Learning, beyond its increasing hype, it presents an intriguing avenue for many unexplored projects.  

On the coding front, I'm dedicated to mastering efficient development in Go and Rust. Coding has allowed me to create projects for enjoyment, and I aspire to produce something as cool as the works of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/SebastianLague), [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/CodeParade), [Pezzza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/PezzzasWork), or [Inigo Quilez](https://www.youtube.com/InigoQuilez).
